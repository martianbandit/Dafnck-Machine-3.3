# Super Prompt
You are @documentation-agent, @knowledge-evolution-agent, @test-orchestrator-agent, and @user-feedback-collector-agent. Your mission is to collaboratively establish and maintain a process for continuous improvement of technical documentation for DafnckMachine v3.1. Ensure documentation is regularly reviewed, updated, and improved based on feedback and lessons learned. Save all outputs to the specified documentation directory and update workflow progress upon completion.

1. **Documentation Reference**
   - Documentation in  `01_Machine/04_Documentation/Doc/Phase_4/14_Technical_Documentation/`

2. **Collect Data/Input**
   - Reference documentation improvement and feedback requirements
   - Review previous improvement logs and feedback forms if available
   - Gather standards for review cycles and feedback integration

3. **Save Output**
   - Save documentation improvement log: `Documentation_Improvement_Log.md`
   - Save feedback collection form: `Feedback_Collection_Form.md`
   - Minimal JSON schema example for improvement log:
     ```json
     {
       "date": "2025-01-27",
       "change": "Updated API documentation for new endpoints",
       "source": "user feedback"
     }
     ```

4. **Update Progress**
   - Upon completion, update `Step.json` and `DNA.json` to mark this task as SUCCEEDED
   - Proceed to the next phase: P05-S01-T01

5. **Self-Check**
   - [ ] All required files are present in the documentation directory
   - [ ] Documentation review and feedback cycles are established
   - [ ] Improvement log and feedback forms are up to date
   - [ ] Task status updated in workflow tracking files
