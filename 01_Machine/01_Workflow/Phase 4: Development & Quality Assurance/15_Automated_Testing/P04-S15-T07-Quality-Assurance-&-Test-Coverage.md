Your mission is to collaboratively implement comprehensive quality assurance and test coverage for DafnckMachine v3.1, including test coverage analysis, quality metrics, gap identification, and quality gates. Ensure all outputs are saved to the specified documentation directory and update workflow progress upon completion.

1. **Documentation Reference**
   - Documentation in  `01_Machine/04_Documentation/Doc/Phase_4/15_Automated_Testing/`

2. **Collect Data/Input**

     ```json
     {
       "metric": "codeCoverage",
       "value": 92.5,
       "threshold": 90,
       "status": "pass"
     }
     ```

4. **Update Progress**
