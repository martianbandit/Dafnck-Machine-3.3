# Super Prompt
@project-initiator-agent (lead), with support from @task-planning-agent: Initialize TaskMaster for DafnckMachine v3.1, ensuring all required files, directories, and configuration are in place for robust task management and workflow orchestration. Document all setup steps, configuration, and environment settings with clear rationale and evidence. Output all guides and configuration files to the required locations. Communicate blockers or gaps in requirements immediately.

1. **Documentation Reference**
   - Documentation in  `01_Machine/04_Documentation/Doc/Phase_4_Development_QA/`

2. **Collect Data/Input**
   - Gather project requirements, workflow needs, and environment constraints from previous phases and team input.
   - Collect preferences and constraints regarding TaskMaster configuration and AI model selection.

3. **Save Output**
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/TaskMaster_Implementation_Guide.md (Markdown)
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Project_Setup_Configuration.json (JSON, schema: {"files": [string], "directories": [string], "settings": object})
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/TaskMaster_Configuration_Guide.md (Markdown)
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Environment_Settings.json (JSON, schema: {"main_model": string, "research_model": string, "api_keys": object, "parameters": object})

4. **Update Progress**
   - Mark this task as done in Step.json and DNA.json when all outputs are complete and reviewed.

5. **Self-Check**
   - [ ] Are all required output files and directories present and complete?
   - [ ] Is the TaskMaster setup and configuration rationale clearly documented?
   - [ ] Are configuration and environment settings justified and reproducible?
   - [ ] Have all blockers and requirements been communicated and addressed?

## Mission Statement
Implement comprehensive task breakdown and management system using TaskMaster to orchestrate development workflow, manage task dependencies, track progress, and ensure efficient development execution for DafnckMachine v3.1 with optimal resource allocation, timeline management, and quality assurance integration.

## Description
Initialize and configure the TaskMaster system for project management. This includes setting up configuration files, directory structure, and initial settings to enable all subsequent TaskMaster operations and task management.

## Super-Prompt
"You are @project-initiator-agent. Your mission is to initialize TaskMaster for DafnckMachine v3.1, ensuring all required files, directories, and configuration are in place for robust task management and workflow orchestration."

## MCP Tools Required
- mcp_taskmaster-ai_initialize_project
- mcp_taskmaster-ai_models

## Result We Want
- TaskMaster project initialized successfully with all required files and directories created.
- TaskMaster AI models and environment settings are configured as specified.

## Add to Brain
- TaskMaster System: Complete task management implementation with breakdown and orchestration capabilities
- Development Workflow: Optimized task-driven development process with dependency management and progress tracking

## Agent Selection Criteria
@project-initiator-agent is chosen for its expertise in taskmaster-setup and project-initialization. @task-planning-agent supports configuration-setup and environment-optimization.

## Tasks (Summary)
- Initialize TaskMaster project structure and configuration
- Configure TaskMaster environment settings, including AI model selection, API keys, and workflow parameters

## Subtasks (Detailed)
### Subtask-01: TaskMaster Project Initialization
- **ID:** P04-T01-S01
- **Description:** Initialize the TaskMaster project, setting up configuration files, directory structure, and initial settings.
- **Agent:** @project-initiator-agent
- **Documentation Links:**
  - [TaskMaster_Implementation_Guide.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/TaskMaster_Implementation_Guide.md)
  - [Project_Setup_Configuration.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Project_Setup_Configuration.json)
- **Steps:**
    1. Initialize TaskMaster project with default settings for DafnckMachine-V3.1 using mcp_taskmaster-ai_initialize_project.
    2. Verify creation of tasks/tasks.json, .taskmasterconfig, tasks/, and scripts/.
- **Success Criteria:**
    - File Exists: tasks/tasks.json
    - File Exists: .taskmasterconfig
    - Directory Exists: tasks/
    - Directory Exists: scripts/
