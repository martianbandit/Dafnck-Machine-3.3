# Super Prompt
You are @coding-agent and @ui-designer-agent. Your mission is to collaboratively design and implement a robust, reusable core component library for DafnckMachine v3.1. Ensure all UI components are accessible, responsive, well-documented, and easily testable. Align with the design system and enable rapid, consistent frontend development. Document all specifications and implementation details. Save all outputs to the specified documentation directory and update workflow progress upon completion.

   - Review previous component documentation if available
   - Gather accessibility and responsive design standards

3. **Save Output**
   - Save base component documentation: `Base_Components_Library.md`
   - Save base component specs: `Component_Specifications.json`
   - Save complex component documentation: `Complex_Components_Library.md`
   - Save advanced component specs: `Advanced_Component_Specs.json`
   - Minimal JSON schema example for specs:
     ```json
     {
       "component": "Button",
       "props": ["variant", "size", "onClick"],
       "accessibility": true,
       "responsive": true
     }
     ```
