# Super Prompt
You are @coding-agent and @ui-designer-agent. Your mission is to collaboratively design and implement a robust, reusable core component library for DafnckMachine v3.1. Ensure all UI components are accessible, responsive, well-documented, and easily testable. Align with the design system and enable rapid, consistent frontend development. Document all specifications and implementation details. Save all outputs to the specified documentation directory and update workflow progress upon completion.

1. **Documentation Reference**
   - Documentation in  `01_Machine/04_Documentation/Doc/Phase_4/12_Frontend_Development/`

2. **Collect Data/Input**
   - Reference design system guidelines and UI requirements
   - Review previous component documentation if available
   - Gather accessibility and responsive design standards

3. **Save Output**
   - Save base component documentation: `Base_Components_Library.md`
   - Save base component specs: `Component_Specifications.json`
   - Save complex component documentation: `Complex_Components_Library.md`
   - Save advanced component specs: `Advanced_Component_Specs.json`
   - Minimal JSON schema example for specs:
     ```json
     {
       "component": "Button",
       "props": ["variant", "size", "onClick"],
       "accessibility": true,
       "responsive": true
     }
     ```

4. **Update Progress**
   - Upon completion, update `Step.json` and `DNA.json` to mark this task as SUCCEEDED
   - Proceed to the next task: P04-S12-T04

5. **Self-Check**
   - [ ] All required files are present in the documentation directory
   - [ ] Components meet accessibility and responsive design standards
   - [ ] Documentation and specs are clear and complete
   - [ ] Task status updated in workflow tracking files

# Mission Statement
Develop a robust, reusable core component library for DafnckMachine v3.1, ensuring consistency, maintainability, and scalability across the frontend application.

# Description
This task covers the implementation of foundational UI components, documentation of usage patterns, and establishment of best practices for extensibility and testing. The component library should align with the design system and support rapid feature development.

# Super-Prompt
You are @coding-agent responsible for building the core component library for DafnckMachine v3.1. Your mission is to create a set of reusable, well-documented, and easily testable UI components that form the backbone of the application's user interface.

# Primary Responsible Agent
@coding-agent - frontend-development

# Supporting Agents
- @ui-designer-agent

# Agent Selection Criteria
@coding-agent is selected for expertise in component implementation, accessibility, and advanced UI features. @ui-designer-agent supports with design and usability.

# Tasks (Summary)
- Implement foundational base components (buttons, inputs, typography, icons, layout)
- Implement advanced complex components (forms, modals, navigation, data tables, charts)
- Ensure accessibility, responsive design, and comprehensive testing

# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask 1: Base Component Implementation
- **ID**: P04-T03-S01
- **Description**: Implement foundational base components including buttons, inputs, typography, icons, and layout components with accessibility features and responsive design.
