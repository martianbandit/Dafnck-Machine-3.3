# Super Prompt
@devops-agent and @system-architect-agent: Collaborate to design and document the CI/CD pipeline, deployment automation, and environment management strategy for DafnckMachine v3.1. Ensure all DevOps practices are secure, efficient, and reproducible. Output all plans and specifications to the required documentation files. Communicate any blockers or architectural concerns immediately.

1. **Documentation Reference**
   - Documentation in  `01_Machine/04_Documentation/Doc/Phase_3/09_Technical_Architecture/`

2. **Collect Data/Input**
   - Gather requirements for CI/CD, deployment, and environment management from previous technical architecture steps and team discussions.

3. **Save Output**
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/09_Technical_Architecture/DevOps_Pipeline_Specifications.md (Markdown)
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/09_Technical_Architecture/CICD_Automation_Plan.json (JSON, schema: {"pipeline": string, "tools": [string], "stages": [string], "automation": object})
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/09_Technical_Architecture/Environment_Management_Strategy.md (Markdown)
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/09_Technical_Architecture/Configuration_Management_Plan.json (JSON, schema: {"environments": [string], "config": object, "secrets": object})

4. **Update Progress**
   - Mark this task as done in Step.json and DNA.json when all outputs are complete and reviewed.

5. Self-Check
   - [ ] Are all required output files present and complete?
   - [ ] Does the CI/CD and deployment plan follow best practices for security and automation?
   - [ ] Is the environment management strategy reproducible and documented?
   - [ ] Have all architectural concerns been communicated and resolved?

# Tasks (Summary)
- Design the CI/CD pipeline and environment management strategy.

# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask-01: CI/CD Pipeline Design
- **ID**: P03-T09-S01
- **Description**: Design the CI/CD pipeline, including build automation, testing integration, deployment automation, and rollback procedures.
- **Agent Assignment**: @devops-agent (cicd-design, automation-pipeline)
- **Documentation Links**:
  - [DevOps_Pipeline_Specifications.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/09_Technical_Architecture/DevOps_Pipeline_Specifications.md)
  - [CICD_Automation_Plan.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/09_Technical_Architecture/CICD_Automation_Plan.json)
