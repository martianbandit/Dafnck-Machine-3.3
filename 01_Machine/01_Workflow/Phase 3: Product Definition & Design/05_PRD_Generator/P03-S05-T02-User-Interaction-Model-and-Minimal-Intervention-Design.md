## Super Prompt
You are @prd-architect-agent. Your job is to design the user interaction model for DafnckMachine v3.1, specifying minimal human intervention, required user inputs, strategic validation points, and transparency mechanisms. Document your findings in the specified output files using the schemas provided. Collaborate as needed to ensure user control and automation.

## 1. Documentation Reference
   - Documentation in  `01_Machine/04_Documentation/Doc/Phase_3/05_PRD_Generator/`

## 2. Collect Data/Input
- Gather requirements for user input, validation points, and transparency
- Analyze best practices for minimal intervention workflows

## 3. Save Output
- Save user interaction model to: `01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/05_PRD_Generator/User_Interaction_Model.md`
- Save transparency framework to: `01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/05_PRD_Generator/Transparency_Framework.md`

### Transparency_Framework.md (Markdown)

# Transparency Framework
- Real-time Dashboards: [string[]]
- Automated Reporting: [string[]]
- Audit Trails: [string[]]
- Emergency Controls: [string[]]
- Quality Milestone Confirmations: [string[]]
```

## 4. Update Progress
- Mark this task as complete in Step.json and DNA.json after outputs are saved and validated.

## 5. Self-Check
- [ ] Are all required output files present and complete?
- [ ] Are user input and validation points clearly documented?
- [ ] Are transparency mechanisms explicit and actionable?
- [ ] Is the workflow minimal and user-centric?
