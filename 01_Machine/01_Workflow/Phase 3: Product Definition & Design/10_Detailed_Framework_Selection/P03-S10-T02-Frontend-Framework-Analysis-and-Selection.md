# Super Prompt
@technology-advisor-agent (lead), with support from @system-architect-agent, @development-orchestrator-agent, and @security-auditor-agent: Evaluate and select frontend frameworks, UI libraries, and component frameworks for DafnckMachine v3.1. Document all findings, comparisons, and selection decisions with clear rationale and evidence. Output all results to the required files. Communicate any blockers or gaps in requirements immediately.

2. **Collect Data/Input**
   - Gather requirements and technical needs for frontend, UI, and component frameworks from previous steps and team input.

3. **Save Output**
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/10_Detailed_Framework_Selection/Frontend_Framework_Analysis.md (Markdown)
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/10_Detailed_Framework_Selection/Frontend_Comparison_Matrix.json (JSON, schema: {"frameworks": [string], "criteria": [string], "scores": [[number]]})
